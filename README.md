# NUnitTestingWebForms
Web Form app using NUnit to test Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture and functionality

Using MVP allows developers to minimize code in view and code-behind files and follow the Single Responsibility Principle by pushing logic to the Presenter. This makes the app loosely coupled to facilitate unit testing

In this example, NUnit and Rhino Mocks are used to test the methods in the Presenter (DisplayDataPresenter)
